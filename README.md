At first add a file named realization_IT_(starting year)-(ending year).xlsx file
The column headers should be like -
  "Name (sv)",	"Nimi (en)".,	"Code",	"Version code",	"Starts",	"Ends",	"Teacher",	"Group"

Then add another file named reservations_Agora_(starting year)-(ending year).xlsx file
The column headers should be like -
  "Subject",	"Starts",	"Ends",	"Room",	"Group",	"Course version",	"Booked for"

After that just run the code one by one cell.


Thank you
